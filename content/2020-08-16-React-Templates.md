## For Gatsby

### gatsby-starter-dimension

Very good looking. However, I think that it is quite limited in use. Good for showing off, but not much information to be shown. Unless I am wrong.

### gatsby-starter-forty

I love this one and used it as my personal website.

```sh
gatsby new gatsby-starter-forty https://github.com/codebushi/gatsby-starter-forty
```





### gatsby-starter-novela

This one is good for blog heavy website, not a landing page.

This one is such good looking. However, I am not sure how easy it is to add blog functionality.
