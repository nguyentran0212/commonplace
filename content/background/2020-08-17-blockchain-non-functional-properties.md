## Advantages

Blockchain technologies may provide advantages for immutability, non-repudiation, integrity, transparency, and equal rights[^1]. 

- If data is contained in a commited transaction, it would eventually become practically immutable.
- The immutable chain of cryptographically signed historical transactions provides non-repudiation of the stored data
- Cryptographic tools also support data integrity
- The public access provides data transparency
- Equal rights allows every participant the same ability to access and manipulate the blockchain. Those rights can weighted by the compute power or stake owned by the miner. 

Trust in the blockchain is achieved from the interactions between nodes within the network[^1].

## Limitations

Data privacy: there are no privileged users, and every participant can join the network to access all the information on blockchain and validate new transactions[^1]. 

Scalability of public blockchain has limits on:

- the size of the data on blockchain, due to the global replication of all data across all full nodes
- the transaction processing rate
- the latency of data transmission. Read latency can be good because nodes can have local copies of the blockchain. However, write latency is typically not good.
