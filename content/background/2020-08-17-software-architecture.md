## Definition of Software Architecture

The software architecture of a software-based system is the high-level structure or relationships between software elements (components and connectors) in the system[^1]. 

- There are many possible options for these structures.
- The choices between these options are important design decisions. 
- Each design decision impacts a number of non-functional requirements positively or negatively. 

Given a design candidate for a software system, software engineers may use qualitative, analytical, or simulation-based tools to evaluate the design for its predicted ability to achieve a non-functional requirement [^1]. 

An important part of software architecture as a practice is to document the design for a system, including the rationale for why specific design options were chosen[^1].
