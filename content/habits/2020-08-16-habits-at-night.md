## Aspirations

I want to make consistent improvement in my fitness, violin playing, and my technical capability. I also want to have some time for other projects that I like, such as making and painting gundam. 

## Recipes

- After changing to my home close, I will go and do three push ups, three pull ups, and three dips, then I will feel victorious. 
- After finishing the last parts of the dinner, I will stand up, and feel great that I have moved in the right direction. 
- After washing the dishes, I will go to the home office, and I will congratulate myself for taking advantage of my night. 
- After turning on the lights in the home office, I will tune my violin, and I will be happy that I have taken my violin out once.
- After putting my violin away, I will take the project that I want to work on out, and I will feel shine that I was moving in the right direction.
