## Aspirations

I want to do deep work consistently, advancing my writing and development work everyday, without compromising the shallow work too much. I don't want to waste my time in the work hours, so that I can have more time to do things that I want after the office hours. 

## Recipes

- After I put my briefcase down, I will go and make a cup of coffee and fill up my water, and feel good that I have started the day. 
- After returning the coffee, I will turn on the computer and enable distraction stopper, and congratulate myself for setting a foundation for a productive day. 
- After enabling distraction stopper, I will check my projects and write down one writing task, and I will feel good about myself.
- After writing down the writing task, I will open my editor and write one paragraph, and I will congratulate myself for going in the right direction.
