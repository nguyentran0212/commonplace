This is a list of technologies that can be used to speed up the development of React-based front-end applications. 



## Boilerplates and Toolchain

The purpose of boilerplates and toolchains is to speed up the creation of React applications, so that developers can focus on coding.

### React-boilerplate

A highly scalable, offline-first foundation with the best DX and a focus on performance and best practices. This is a production-ready boilerplate, and as such optimized for browsers, not for beginners.

Redux plays an important role in this boilerplate, to it would be better to learn Redux first.

## React UI Component Libraries and Frameworks

These libraries and frameworks help speeding up the development of UI. Usually, they come with their own CSS already, so developers only need to supply business logic (i.e., props and state, and perhaps Redux stores)

### Material UI

Material UI is a library of React components that implement Google's Material Design. It is the most popular and widely used React UI library on GitHub.
