Loading data usually happens asynchronously in applications. In Javascript, this is done with callbacks or async/await. Either way, it is not an easy task. The following libraries help with handling asynchronous data loading and displaying the right message when the data is being loaded (or any kind of asynchronous processing is being done).



## react-async

React component and hook for declarative promise resolution and data fetching. Makes it easy to handle every state of the asynchronous process, without assumptions about the shape of your data or the type of request. Use it with `fetch`, Axios or other data fetching libraries, even GraphQL.
