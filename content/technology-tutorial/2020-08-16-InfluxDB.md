## Key Concepts

*This section has been adopted with minimal modification from the official InfluxDB documentation.* 

Sample data shows the number of butterflies and honeybees counted by two scientists (`langstroth` and `perpetua`) in two locations (location `1` and location `2`) over the time period from August 18, 2015 at midnight through August 18, 2015 at 6:12 AM. Assume that the data lives in a database called `my_database` and are subject to the `autogen` retention policy (more on databases and retention policies to come).

| time                     | **butterflies** | **honeybees** | **location** | **scientist** |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| 2015-08-18T00:00:00Z     | 12              | 23            | 1            | langstroth    |
| 2015-08-18T00:00:00Z     | 1               | 30            | 1            | perpetua      |
| 2015-08-18T00:06:00Z     | 11              | 28            | 1            | langstroth    |
| **2015-08-18T00:06:00Z** | **3**           | **28**        | **1**        | **perpetua**  |
| 2015-08-18T05:54:00Z     | 2               | 11            | 2            | langstroth    |
| 2015-08-18T06:00:00Z     | 1               | 10            | 2            | langstroth    |
| 2015-08-18T06:06:00Z     | 8               | 23            | 2            | perpetua      |
| 2015-08-18T06:12:00Z     | 7               | 22            | 2            | perpetua      |



InfluxDB is a time series database so it makes sense to start with what is at the root of everything we do: time. In the data above there’s a column called `time` - all data in InfluxDB have that column. `time` stores timestamps, and the ***timestamp*** shows the date and time, in [RFC3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) UTC, associated with particular data.

The next two columns, called `butterflies` and `honeybees`, are fields. Fields are made up of field keys and field values. ***Field keys*** (`butterflies` and `honeybees`) are strings; the field key `butterflies` tells us that the field values `12`-`7` refer to butterflies and the field key `honeybees` tells us that the field values `23`-`22` refer to, well, honeybees.

***Field values*** are your data; they can be strings, floats, integers, or Booleans, and, because InfluxDB is a time series database, a field value is always associated with a timestamp. The field values in the sample data are:

```
12   23
1    30
11   28
3    28
2    11
1    10
8    23
7    22
```

In the data above, the collection of field-key and field-value pairs make up a ***field set***. Here are all eight field sets in the sample data:

- `butterflies = 12 honeybees = 23`
- `butterflies = 1 honeybees = 30`
- `butterflies = 11 honeybees = 28`
- `butterflies = 3 honeybees = 28`
- `butterflies = 2 honeybees = 11`
- `butterflies = 1 honeybees = 10`
- `butterflies = 8 honeybees = 23`
- `butterflies = 7 honeybees = 22`

Fields are a required piece of the InfluxDB data structure - you cannot have data in InfluxDB without fields. It’s also important to note that fields are not indexed. [Queries](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/concepts/glossary/#query) that use field values as filters must scan all values that match the other conditions in the query. As a result, those queries are not performant relative to queries on tags (more on tags below). In general, fields should not contain commonly-queried metadata.

The last two columns in the sample data, called `location` and `scientist`, are tags. Tags are made up of tag keys and tag values. Both ***tag keys*** and ***tag values*** are stored as strings and record metadata. The tag keys in the sample data are `location` and `scientist`. The tag key `location` has two tag values: `1` and `2`. The tag key `scientist` also has two tag values: `langstroth` and `perpetua`.

In the data above, the ***tag set*** is the different combinations of all the tag key-value pairs. The four tag sets in the sample data are:

- `location = 1`, `scientist = langstroth`
- `location = 2`, `scientist = langstroth`
- `location = 1`, `scientist = perpetua`
- `location = 2`, `scientist = perpetua`

Tags are optional. You don’t need to have tags in your data structure, but it’s generally a good idea to make use of them because, unlike fields, tags are indexed. This means that queries on tags are faster and that tags are ideal for storing commonly-queried metadata.

Avoid using the following reserved keys:

- `_field`
- `_measurement`
- `time`

If reserved keys are included as a tag or field key, the associated point is discarded.

> Say you notice that most of your queries focus on the values of the field keys `honeybees` and `butterflies`:

> ```
> SELECT * FROM "census" WHERE "butterflies" = 1` `SELECT * FROM "census" WHERE "honeybees" = 23
> ```

> Because fields aren’t indexed, InfluxDB scans every value of `butterflies` in the first query and every value of `honeybees` in the second query before it provides a response. That behavior can hurt query response times - especially on a much larger scale. To optimize your queries, it may be beneficial to rearrange your [schema](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/concepts/glossary/#schema) such that the fields (`butterflies` and `honeybees`) become the tags and the tags (`location` and `scientist`) become the fields:

> | 2015-08-18T00:00:00Z     | 1            | perpetua      | 1               | 30            |

> Now that `butterflies` and `honeybees` are tags, InfluxDB won’t have to scan every one of their values when it performs the queries above - this means that your queries are even faster.

The ***measurement*** acts as a container for tags, fields, and the `time` column, and the measurement name is the description of the data that are stored in the associated fields. Measurement names are strings, and, for any SQL users out there, a measurement is conceptually similar to a table. The only measurement in the sample data is `census`. The name `census` tells us that the field values record the number of `butterflies` and `honeybees` - not their size, direction, or some sort of happiness index.

A single measurement can belong to different retention policies. A ***retention policy*** describes how long InfluxDB keeps data (`DURATION`) and how many copies of this data is stored in the cluster (`REPLICATION`). If you’re interested in reading more about retention policies, check out [Database Management](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/query_language/database_management/#retention-policy-management).

Replication factors do not serve a purpose with single node instances.

In the sample data, everything in the `census` measurement belongs to the `autogen` retention policy. InfluxDB automatically creates that retention policy; it has an infinite duration and a replication factor set to one.

In InfluxDB, a ***series*** is a collection of points that share a measurement, tag set, and field key. The data above consist of eight series:

| Series number | Measurement | Tag set                                 | Field key     |
| ------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| series 1      | `census`    | `location = 1`,`scientist = langstroth` | `butterflies` |
| series 2      | `census`    | `location = 2`,`scientist = langstroth` | `butterflies` |
| series 3      | `census`    | `location = 1`,`scientist = perpetua`   | `butterflies` |
| series 4      | `census`    | `location = 2`,`scientist = perpetua`   | `butterflies` |
| series 5      | `census`    | `location = 1`,`scientist = langstroth` | `honeybees`   |
| series 6      | `census`    | `location = 2`,`scientist = langstroth` | `honeybees`   |
| series 7      | `census`    | `location = 1`,`scientist = perpetua`   | `honeybees`   |
| series 8      | `census`    | `location = 2`,`scientist = perpetua`   | `honeybees`   |

Understanding the concept of a series is essential when designing your [schema](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/concepts/glossary/#schema) and when working with your data in InfluxDB.

A ***point*** represents a single data record that has four components: a measurement, tag set, field set, and a timestamp. A point is uniquely identified by its series and timestamp.

For example, here’s a single point:

```
name: census
-----------------
time                    butterflies honeybees   location    scientist
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z    1           30          1           perpetua
```

The point in this example is part of series 3 and defined by the measurement (`census`), the tag set (`location = 1`, `scientist = perpetua`), the field set (`butterflies = 1`, `honeybees = 30`), and the timestamp `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z`.

All of the stuff we’ve just covered is stored in a database - the sample data are in the database `my_database`. An InfluxDB ***database*** is similar to traditional relational databases and serves as a logical container for users, retention policies, continuous queries, and, of course, your time series data. See [Authentication and Authorization](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/administration/authentication_and_authorization/) and [Continuous Queries](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/query_language/continuous_queries/) for more on those topics.

Databases can have several users, continuous queries, retention policies, and measurements. InfluxDB is a schemaless database which means it’s easy to add new measurements, tags, and fields at any time. It’s designed to make working with time series data awesome.
